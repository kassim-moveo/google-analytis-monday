 * See documentation: [AuthorizeButton](https://justinmahar.github.io/react-analytics-charts/AuthorizeButton)

 *
 * After signing in, the `onSignIn` handler is called. This handler can be used to update the view once signed in. The handler is not called if already signed in.
 *
 * To check if the user is already authorized, you can use the [`useAnalyticsApi`](https://justinmahar.github.io/react-use-analytics-api/useAnalyticsApi) hook. A full example is available [here](https://justinmahar.github.io/react-analytics-charts/AuthorizeButton#example).
