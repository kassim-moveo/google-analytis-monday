 * A "bounce" occurs when a visitor arrives at your site and promptly leaves without interacting any further.
 *
 * The bounce rate is the percentage of users who bounce. A lower bounce rate indicates higher initial engagement. ⛹️‍♂️
 *
 * Useful for seeing how well a site grabs people's attention and "hooks" them into staying.

 * Refer to the [Charts Overview](https://justinmahar.github.io/react-analytics-charts/charts) for a list of all charts available.
