 *  Use this hook to load and access the [Google Analytics Embed API](https://ga-dev-tools.appspot.com/embed-api/) (`gapi`).
 *
 * The hook will run the [library loading script from Google](https://developers.google.com/analytics/devguides/reporting/embed/v1/getting-started#step-2), grab the API out from `window.gapi` (where Google loads it to), and store it as a singleton.
 * It will reference the singleton thereafter, keeping `window` interaction to a minimum.
 *
 * State changes that happen outside of React (such as API readiness and [authorization](https://justinmahar.github.io/react-use-analytics-api/useAuthorize)) are synchronized across all hooks via a singleton emitter effect. This allows you to use the hook in multiple places while keeping them all in sync.
